# Portfolio Website

## Overview
Hello there! This website acts as a personal portfolio / resume for users to read through and learn about who I am and what experience I have in STEM. It took about 5 days of programming over the course of about 16 hours to create and finish the deployment of. The website features a navbar for users to easily travel to specific areas of the website, as well as a contact form powered by Web3Forms to send emails directly to my inbox.

## Instructions
This website can be accessed through Vercel. Simply scroll through the page to read about my skillset, experience, and projects. You can use the navigation bar fixed to the top of the page to travel throughout the page quickly. You can also send me an email directly by entering your name, email, and message in the contact form in the bottom section of the website. Clicking the blue circles in the project carousel will allow you to scroll through my favorite technical projects I've built with Github links attached.

## Motivation
My main motivation for creating this project was found in my desire to learn React JS and Tailwind CSS, as well as simply to create something visually appealing. While I don't want to work as a software developer or engineer as a job, I love programming, and this project helped me learn to build pretty websites, a skill I plan to use in future projects. I also just really wanted to recount all of my achievements before college application season kicks into gear!

## Challenges and Reflection
* Firstly, this project took quite a while because it was my very first time making anything with React JS and Tailwind CSS. Although I have lots of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript experience, I struggled a lot with this project through having to teach myself so many different concepts, as React is incredibly different from how HTML normally works, and Node Package Manager was something I had never heard of prior to this project. I had to learn npm syntax and techniques entirely from scratch, which definitely increased the amount of time I spent on this project.
* Secondly, I struggled a lot with 
* Last but not least, I had a plethora of problems deploying the finished site using both Github Pages and Vercel. When I initially completed the project, I was excited to deploy it, but to my surprised, Githib couldn't locate any of my files, and the website displayed as a blank page! I tried everything from editing workflows to source folders, but nothing seemed to work until I changed the homepage, predeploy, and deploy on my package.json file. Throughout the struggle, I learned a lot about how building and deploying websites works.
